# jest-styled-components with Storybook Test Runner - Minimum Configuration Repository

This repository demonstrates a minimal setup for using `jest-styled-components` with the `storybook` `test-runner`. The purpose of this setup is to facilitate understanding of the integration issues between `jest-styled-components` and `storybook`.

## Important: Currently Not Operational

The code in this repository is currently non-operational. It illustrates compatibility issues between `jest-styled-components` and the `storybook` test-runner. We are seeking community support and suggestions to resolve this issue.

## Configuration

- `jest-styled-components`: 7.2.0
- `storybook`: 7.6.7
- `test-runner`: 0.16.0

## Snapshot Content Sample

The snapshots generated by the `test-runner` appear as follows:

```snap
// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP

exports[\`Button Default smoke-test 1\`] = \`
<button class="sc-beySPh fvFDzo">
default button
</button>
\`;
```

This snapshot represents the result of rendering React components through a headless browser, which is the approach taken by the `storybook` `test-runner`. It is important to note that this results in a format different from what `jest-styled-components` expects, which typically involves ReactNode or HTMLElement.
